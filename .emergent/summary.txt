<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a professional tennis application. The work has been highly iterative, guided by several detailed product requirement documents (PRDs) provided by the user in French.

The initial requests included:
1.  Refactoring the backend.
2.  Integrating a free email service for system notifications (Resend was chosen).
3.  Migrating backend data from static files to a database (MongoDB).
4.  Adding a  field to tournaments to filter them based on user preferences.

Later, the user provided two large markdown documents detailing new features:
1.  **Admin Dashboard:** A complete web-based dashboard for administrators to monitor users and app metrics. This has been fully implemented.
2.  **Fluid UX & Onboarding:** A complete redesign of the user experience focusing on fluid inputs to minimize friction, including a new 7-step initial onboarding flow and a 3-module progressive onboarding system. The current task is to build the foundational UI components for this new UX.

**User's preferred language**: French. The next agent MUST respond in French.

**what currently exists?**
The project consists of a React Native (Expo) mobile application and a Python (Flask) backend connected to a MongoDB database.
- The backend has been refactored into a modular structure with separate route and service files.
- Resend is integrated for sending emails.
- All application data (tournaments, users, alerts) is served from a MongoDB database via API endpoints.
- The frontend has been updated to consume data from these APIs instead of static files.
- A complete, functional admin dashboard is available at the  route, with features for user management and metric visualization.
- The agent has started creating the new Fluid Input components required for the next phase of development.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the middle of creating nine Fluid Input UI components as specified in the user's PRD for the new Fluid UX. It successfully created the first five components.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N (Components have been created but not yet integrated or tested).
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should first create a temporary screen to render and test all 9 components before integrating them into the onboarding flow.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues. All pending work relates to new feature implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1: Create the remaining Fluid Input components (P0)**
    *   **Where to resume:** The agent has created 5 of 9 components in . It needs to create the following four files based on the specifications in the user-provided  document:
        1.  
        2.  
        3.  
        4.  
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the set of foundational UI components required to build the new fluid onboarding experience.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0: Implement the 7-Step Initial Onboarding Flow.** This is the immediate next task after creating the fluid components. It involves creating 7 new screens for user registration (, , , etc.) using the newly created fluid input components, as detailed in the  file (Phase 2).
    *   **P1: Implement the 3 Progressive Onboarding Modules.** This involves creating contextually triggered bottom sheets for gathering user preferences on  (Travel),  (Accommodation), and  (Food) (Phase 3 of ).
    *   **P2: Integrate Fluid Inputs into Core App.** Refactor existing forms and inputs throughout the application (e.g., event creation) to use the new fluid components, improving the overall UX (Phase 4 of ).

*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **Core Feature Refinement:** Improve core features like Calendar, Staff Management, and the Document Vault using the new fluid design principles (Phase 5 of ).
    *   **UI/UX Polish:** Add animations, haptic feedback, loading states, and error handling across the app (Phase 6 of ).
    *   **Testing & Deployment:** Conduct comprehensive testing and prepare the application for submission to app stores (Phase 7 of ).

**Completed work in this session**
- **Backend Data Migration:** Migrated application data from static JSON files to a live MongoDB database. Created all necessary API endpoints and a  script.
- **Backend Refactoring:** Re-architected the Flask backend from a monolithic  to a modular structure with  and .
- **Resend Email Integration:** Integrated the Resend API for sending transactional emails and created corresponding backend endpoints.
- **Frontend API Integration:** Rewrote the main application screen () to fetch data dynamically from the new backend APIs.
- **Admin Dashboard (Full Stack):** Designed and built a complete admin dashboard from scratch, including all backend APIs () and a full React frontend with multiple pages and components under .
- **Fluid Input Component Creation (Partial):** Created the first 5 of 9 requested Fluid Input components in .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
There are no unfixed issues.
